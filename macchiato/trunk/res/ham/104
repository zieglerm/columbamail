I am not quite sure I understand you here. What do you think about "full
download"/"headers only + spam filter when displaying" option defaulting
to full download?

What do you mean by server-side [spam] filtering? That people run their
own spam filter on server? (we may set spam flag by X-Spam flag then)

Agreed.

You may disable filtering incoming messages and use "Check spam" filter
rule. In reply to Jeff's mail I talk about "Is spam" rule which is
filter part here. And I will add vFolder/search rule to my task list.

Oh, and I considered adding it to popup menu in my reply to Mark and
Anna. Interesting how we all have different view on that. Let see what
Anna think.

I wanted to keep it simple. I thought it will be possible to do it
per-account using Filters/Check spam rule. But now I see there's two
sets of filter rules, incoming/outcoming rules. Doesn't make it sense to
have generally filter rules per account?

I am for vFolder with hidden spam messages. I don't see how it can be
useful to have it per account.

I think I will use g_module but keep it simple and not use gobject - so
people who want write plugin don't have to learn glib type system.

okie, I wasn't aware of that, thanks for info.

I understand it so that it will delete also messages marked for delete
in source folders of that vFolder, right? So user may loose mail in
Trash which wasn't expunged yet. Or did I misunderstood it?

I am not sure if we talk about the same. I need this in case message in
Spam vFolder is not spam and user press NoSpam button, I need to unset
spam flag on that message and make that message disappear from Spam
vFolder - this is the point I care about - normally messages stays in
vFolder until expunge (IIRC). Because of reasons I described above I
don't want to expunge.

If we allow listing of spam messages in source folder then we may want
this. But if not then we don't need anything special, user will be able
to delete messages as usual.

That's great.

Agreed. I prefer to hide them.

Hmm, maybe. But definitely not per folder basis, right?

I guess I meant rather visibility here?

Yeah, I think we agree here. Default global simple solution + filter
rules (can these be per folder?).

Huh, pretty long mail to reply, I am finally through. Thanks for your
comments Michael.

I guess I will update my plan now and resend it so we don't forget
anything.

Kathmandu Temple Kiff possesses all of the positive virtues fine ganja/cannabis without any of the negatives.  An amalgamation of high concentrates of rare euphoric herbas, Kathmandu is offered in a solid jigget/bar format and is actually more UPLIFTING & POISED than cannabis / marijuana while rendering Euphoria, Happiness, Mood-Enhancement, Stress/Depression Relief and promoting contemplativeness, creativity, better sleep, lucid dreaming ... and enhancing the sexual experience!!!

Here is what our customers are saying about Kathmandu Temple Kiff:

"Thank you so much for the Temple Kiff. It is everything you guys claim, and then some! I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is legal!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you."
-- Frankie R.

"I'm a man of my 40's and I really know my stuff.  I don't drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path. I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple Kiff. It really amazes me how this stuff tastes exactly like the lebanese red and blond hash I used to smoke in the 70's and it has a much more pleasurable effect.  I am very satisfied with this product.  I like it a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!  Folks,  this is the real stuff!  Look no further!!"
-- A.J.

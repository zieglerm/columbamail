B></FONT> <BR>
<BR>
Info Broker courses offers an extensive training course in "Pre-Employment=
 Screening and Information Brokering."<BR>
<BR>
The Pre-Employment Screening/Information Broker course is an 
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> easily understood, visionary plan</B></FONT>  =
that teaches you state-of-the-art techniques to establish yourself in a pr=
ofession that is in extremely high demand.<BR>
<BR>
Our course teaches you how to tap into an expanding need of virtually ever=
y business; the need for timely, accurate pre-employment screening and rel=
iable information in other fields as well.<BR>
<BR>
In the current economy, with so many people looking for jobs, employers ac=
tively need help screening the people they are thinking about hiring.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> With this course, you can create a business th=
at should earn you between $8,000 and $12,000 per month!</B></FONT> <BR>
<BR>
As a professional pre-employment specialist/information broker, you will b=
e able to research and compile data and background information on subjects=
 and individuals in every field imaginable, for 
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> companies all over the globe</B></FONT> .  Usi=
ng your home computer, as well as other resources, you will be able to loc=
ate all of the information you'll need.<BR>
<BR>
There is virtually no end to the amount of data you an easily access throu=
gh your computer, without so much as leaving your home.  Information such =
as, technical and trade publications, credit reports, UCC filings, the Lib=
rary of Congress, University libraries and much more!<BR>
<BR>
In order to remain competitive and profitable in our global economy, compa=
nies require more and more information on every subject from current marke=
t trends to employment statistics.  Successful companies need all types of=
 information, from 
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> intelligence about their competitors</B></FONT=
>  to reports on the newest technical developments, to research on job app=
licants.<BR>
<BR>
In the year 2000, over 10 billion dollars was spent by companies in the pu=
rchase of information.  
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> In the days since the attacks on America on Se=
ptember 11, 2001, security is one of the most important concerns of people=
 all over America, private individuals as well as Corporations are doing m=
ore and more background checking and security related searching, not only =
of potential employees, but also of their present employees.</B></FONT>  S=
ecurity is a multi-billion dollar a year business.  Recent events have mad=
e it jump to the forefront of our consciousness, and companies are now wil=
ling to pay for the best security screening money can buy.<BR>
<BR>
Pre-Employment screening is in extremely high demand because companies are=
 facing more and more pressure to do more in-depth screening of their job =
applicants.  For example: one of the worlds largest restaurant chains rece=
ntly lost a $2 million law suit, due to hiring an individual, who it later=
 came out, had an extensive criminal record as a sexual offender.   It is =
extremely important that business owners take the responsibility, and the =
necessary steps to perform pre-employment screening!<BR>
<BR>
Why would someone hire you?  The answer is that for most companies, housin=
g their own information and screening services is too expensive and time c=
onsuming.  The vast majority of business managers don't have the slightest=
 idea of how to locate information on someone or check their educational h=
istory, employment or criminal backgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
This is where you come in!  You offer to do the research for them!  Presen=
t them with the information they require, and receive a lucrative fee for =
just a few minutes of work!  
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> As a Pre-Employment consultant you can charge =
from $100 to $500 and up, for each applicant you research.</B></FONT> <BR>
<BR>
Our course will provide you with the skills and techniques to provide this=
 information, and establish yourself in an exciting, professional, and fin=
ancially rewarding career.<BR>
<BR>
Using the steps in the course, you will be in a position to save companies=
 many thousands of dollars because their information gathering is either i=
nadequate or non-existent.<BR>
<BR>
You will be able to provide information on things like:<BR>
<BR>
 <UL><LI>A prospective employee has already filed for workman's compensati=
on at their last three jobs.<BR>
<LI>An applicant has a criminal record or negligent driving record.<BR>
<LI>A new client has past due accounts and bad debts at many other busines=
ses or<BR>
<LI>A client or vendor already has lawsuits pending, and the courts have a=
lready awarded thousands of dollars of judgments against them.<BR>
</LI></LI></LI></LI></UL> <BR>
A typical pre-employment screening might contain the following scenario:<B=
R>
<BR>
A business owner contacts you to perform a verification check on an applic=
ant.  You present your package prices for a basic background verification =
check.  The client also wants you to check for criminal convictions.<BR>
<BR>
You prepare a standard agreement letter (sample letters are included in th=
e manual), and send it to your client.  The basic background verification =
fee is $100 to $200.  You add another $75-$95 for checking criminal record=
s and/or DMV files.  The contract totals $175-$295.<BR>
<BR>
You might verify the address, education, past-employment, occupational lic=
ensing, and criminal records by accessing various confidential databases, =
and various other resources.  This should take about 1-2 hours.<BR>
<BR>
Prepare a report on the applicant and present it to the business owner, al=
ong with your bill.  An even more extensive background check might be call=
ed for if the applicant passes the initial screening.<BR>
<BR>
A sample research project might look something like this:<BR>
<BR>
A business owner is considering opening another office in a new city or st=
ate.  He needs information in several areas, including \endash  what is th=
e competition in the area?  How many employees do they have?  Are they mak=
ing a profit?  The client may also want to know what is the cost of office=
 space in the area?  Is the local government offering any incentives to a =
new business? <BR>
<BR>
You set a fee for your services, typically $40-$120 an hour.  In some case=
s, the business owner may put you on retainer for the extent of the projec=
t, or even permanently.<BR>
<BR>
You prepare a letter outlining the project and your fee structure; since w=
e supply sample forms to you along with your manual, this is simple and fa=
st to do.<BR>
<BR>
You perform the research, compile the information, and prepare a report to=
 send to your client along with your bill.  A report like this might cost =
$200, $500, or even $5,000, depending on the research required.<BR>
<BR>
There are also many ways to make additional income.  Services such as,<BR>
interviewing and screening job candidates, credit checks, reference verifi=
cation<BR>
and research in Civil Records, Military Records, Property Records, Uniform=
<BR>
Commercial code (UCC) and more.  These are areas of pre-employment<BR>
consulting in which you can become a valuable asset to any employer.<BR>
<BR>
The course takes you step-by-step through everything you need to know.  We=
<BR>
show you how to access public records nationwide in order to do things lik=
e verify<BR>
educational background, employment history and criminal convictions.<BR>
<BR>
You will have access to one of the most sophisticated database and reporti=
ng<BR>
capabilities in the country.  We even made arrangements to supply you with=
 <BR>
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> complete Employment Screening reports</B></FON=
T> , ready to present to your clients.  <BR>
These reports are supplied to you at an incredible discount because of the=
 size <BR>
of our company nationally.  You just sign your agreement with your client =
and mail <BR>
or fax in a request for a Screening.  You should make at least a 50% profi=
t on each <BR>
screening with minimal effort on your part.  The course shows you how to d=
o everything <BR>
on your own, or use our national resources.<BR>
<BR>
We also include samples of letters, contracts, and forms in the manual.  A=
s well<BR>
as sample brochures, business cards and letterhead.  Everything you need\'=
85A to Z.<BR>
<BR>

ands of dollars per month.  Here are some quotes from several of our assoc=

've achieved without this course.   It was simply written, and easy to und=
erstand.  I never dreamed I would be 
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> making $8,000 a month</B></FONT> . I expect to=
